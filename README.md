# description #
This project is to show several different sorting algorithms using the java swing packages.
The purpose of this project is to show how efficient each sorting algorithm is visually for
any learners that are new to sorting algorithms and have a trouble visualizing it. 

# types of algorithms #
    - Bubble Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Quick Sort

# how to run #
 - open files up in correct directory
 - type in terminal:    javax src/app.java
 - next type in terminal    java src/app
